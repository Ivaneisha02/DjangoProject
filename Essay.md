# Essay
## 
For my final project I created a personal website that will serve  as a portfolio of my personal projects and passions for the 
purpose of enhancing my resume and making me a more competitive candidate for technical opportunities. My website mainly uses 
the Django framework for python. The limitations of said project includes the lack of complex classes that perform calculations
which may have been a misunderstanding on my part. Another limitation of my project is the lack of separate projects because 
this is my first project. There will be additions of personal projects and computer science endeavors added to my website as 
I progress in my education and be exposed to more interesting computing topics and fields.

Some concepts that I have learned in class that have proved most useful for the creation of my project include lessons about 
frameworks, modules, classes, data structures and functions. I utilized the Django framework which is used for web development
using python in order to make the process of developing easier as it provides lots of files and functions that made the 
process easier for me.  The lesson on modules and classes proved useful as well. In several of my files I had to import 
from modules in order to make certain functionality available to my files and thus produce the intended outcome. Some classes 
were provided by the Django framework but the lessons on classes enabled me to understand the purpose of said functions and 
be more knowledgeable of my project. The lessons on data structures were most useful in my opinion because lots of my work 
in ensuring routes were correct relied on data structures such as lists and dictionaries. These structures were critical
because my website heavily relies on routes because it is multipage and will be updated to include many more pages. Functions
were also particularly useful because they provided access to the different views of my webpage. If I had not learned how 
to write functions in this class or Intro to computer science I would have had trouble constructing the different views of
my webpage. Another lesson that proved useful was the concept of testing your code while writing it. Although my project
does not seem like much, the process of continuously testing my code while writing it proved to be worth the trouble as it 
encouraged me to research documentation and read over previous in class lessons in order to correct my mistakes.
